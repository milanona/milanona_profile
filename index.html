      Hello hello everyone! My name is Milana and I'm a 1st year student at ESSEC Business School where I'm currently pursuing a Global Bachelor in Business Administration! Welcome to my page:)

    <h2>About me!</h2>
    <p>
      Let me tell you a bit about myself! Okay, so letâ€™s start with the basics. I am just Kazakhstani, born in Almaty, Kazakhstan. I know a little Kazakh language, and I can speak fluently in Russian, English, and French. Aside from that, I consider myself quite extroverted and solar. I also have lots of different interests which you will discover as you scroll down my page!
    </p>
    <p>I graduated from "Lyceum #134". I also have a lot of funny and cheerful friends. Their names are Benazir Adiyat and Damir. We finished the lyceum together with them.</p>

    <h2>My interests!</h2>
    <p>I present to you: my second Instagram account and its feed. This profile paints a very clear picture of my interests. I'm super into fashion, photography, art, and good food. I also like to spend an excessive amount of time on Social Media and love going out a little too much... all of which you can clearly see right here</p>

    <h2>Travels</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, I have been very lucky to be given the chance to travel all around the world. I've explored 6 continents and been to over 30 countries. I love traveling and exploring new places. I firmly believe that any excuse is a valid excuse to catch a flight. </p>
